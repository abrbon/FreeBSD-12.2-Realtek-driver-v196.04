This is a new build for the Realtek Ethernet Driver v1.96.04 for FreeBSD 12.2

The standard realtek driver in FreeBSD 12.2 is old and gives a lot of problems 
especially with copying large files. The network connection just stops and 
most of the time you need to restart your server again.

This driver is build on FreeBSD 12.2 amd64 and can also be used on TrueNAS 12.x
